This project builds a complete sentiment-analysis pipeline for IMDB movie reviews. I used two different NLP techniques (BOW and TF-IDF) to tokenize and convert each text into numerical features. 
Using these representations, I trained and evaluated a Decision Tree and a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether a review is positive or negative. 
I compared the models using accuracy and detailed classification metrics, and for the Decision Tree, examined which words contributed most to its predictions.
