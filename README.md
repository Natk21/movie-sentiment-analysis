This project builds a complete sentiment-analysis pipeline for IMDB movie reviews. I used two NLP techniques: Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF vectroization to tokenize each review and convert text into numerical features.
Using these representations, I trained and evaluated a Decision Tree and a Logistic Regression classifier to predict whether a review is positive or negative. 
Finally, I compared the models using accuracy and detailed classification metrics, and for the Decision Tree, examined which words contributed most to its predictions.
